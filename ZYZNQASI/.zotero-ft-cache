Abstract
Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for
specific regions in images and videos remains a
fundamental challenge for vision-language mod
els. We introduce the Describe Anything Model
(DAM), a model designed for detailed localized
captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details
and global context through two key innovations:
a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution en
coding of targeted regions, and a localized vision
backbone, which integrates precise localization
with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity
of high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi
supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline
(DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmenta
tion datasets and expands to unlabeled web images
using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate DLC without relying on refer
ence captions. DAM sets new state-of-the-art on 7
benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level,
and detailed multi-sentence localized image and
video captioning.
1. Introduction
Image captioning has been a longstanding challenge in computer vision and natural language processing [18], as it involves understanding and describing visual content in natural language. While recent VisionLanguage Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive results in image-level captioning, generating detailed and accurate captions for specific regions within an image remains an open problem. This challenge intensifies with videos, where models must additionally capture dynamic visual content, such as human actions, object motions, and human-object interactions. If resolved, it would open new doors for fine-grained grounded image/video understanding [49, 102] and generation [40, 42].
Most existing VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o [54]) lack mechanisms for precise localization. Recent approaches that empower VLMs to take 2D localization cues such as bounding boxes [30, 82, 85, 101] often yield brief phrases rather than detailed descriptions. While there are methods [15, 45, 93, 95, 99, 100] that produce longer captions, they provide minimal detail or in

clude unrelated content from other regions, as shown in Fig. 5. This raises the question: What makes detailed localized captioning (DLC) so challenging?
We identify three key obstacles to DLC:
1. Loss of Region Details: As shown in Fig. 2, prior methods extract local features from global image representations, often leading to loss of fine-grained details—particularly for small objects in complex scenes. By the time the LLM processes the visual features, crucial details necessary for generating precise captions are already lost. Cropping the region of interest may enhance detail but risks losing essential contextual cues.
2. Scarcity of High-Quality Datasets: Datasets such as RefCOCOs [31, 50] and Visual Genome [34] typically offer only short phrases that do not suffice for training models to generate rich, detailed captions. Recent synthetic data approaches [45, 93] are based on bounding boxes that could not precisely convey the exact region of interests, while methods that rely on global captions [28] may have difficulty capturing non-salient regions.
3. Limitations in Benchmarks: Prior localized captioning benchmarks compare generated captions against reference captions using languagebased image captioning metrics [2, 5, 43, 56, 79] or LLM-based scoring [95, 96]. However, such techniques are not very applicable to DLC. Since the reference captions provided in the benchmarks often lack comprehensive details of the region, DLC models are often unfairly penalized for correct details not explicitly mentioned in the reference.
We propose the following solutions to these challenges:
To tackle the loss of details in regional features, we propose the Describe Anything Model (DAM), which preserves both local detail and global context. DAM achieves this through two key innovations (Fig. 3): 1) the focal prompt, which encodes the region of interest with high token density, and 2) the localized vision backbone, which ensures precise localization while integrating global context. These components enable DAM to generate detailed and accurate captions, even for small objects in complex scenes.

Figure 2: Top: Prior regional captioners derive regional features from global image representations, leading to vague descriptions. Bottom: Zooming in (cropping the image region) enhances detail but loses contextual cues, degrading recognition. This underscores the need for a design that encodes detail-rich regional features while preserving context for improved DLC performance.
To overcome the scarcity of high-quality DLC datasets, we introduce Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP) to generate high-quality localized captions in two stages. First, leveraging highquality masks and keywords (e.g., class names, part names, or entities) from human-annotated segmentation datasets, we query a VLM to expand each keyword into a detailed caption given each mask-referred region. Second, inspired by self-training-based SSL in image classification [7, 8, 37, 69, 88], DLC-SDP performs self-training with web images as an unlabeled dataset and segmentation datasets as labeled data. An LLM further summarizes descriptions into multiple granularities, yielding a diverse dataset with high-quality localized captions, enabling our model to outperform strong API-only baselines such as GPT4o [54] and o1 [55].
To mitigate the limitations of current benchmarks, we introduce DLC-Bench, which evaluates detailed localized captions based on a set of predefined positive and negative attributes for each region, eliminating the reliance on comprehensive reference captions. This approach provides a more flexible and accurate evaluation, encouraging models to generate informative and precise descriptions.
We summarize our contributions as follows:

2. Related Work
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). VLMs integrate visual and textual inputs for multimodal understanding and are broadly classified into BLIP-style [1, 3, 22, 25, 36, 38, 39] and LLaVA-style [4, 6, 9, 19, 20, 44, 4648, 81, 87, 103]. However, these models lack precise localization capabilities, limiting their ability to generate regional descriptions.
Localized Image Captioning. While general VLMs generate image-level captions, localized captioning requires fine-grained regional descriptions. SoM [91, 92] augments VLMs with visual markers, but these markers may blend with the background, as discussed in App. A. Region-aware VLMs [15, 28, 30, 45, 57, 61, 70, 82, 83, 95, 99–101] introduce regional referring inputs. Recent efforts such as Merlin, Artemis, and VideoRefer [59, 94, 96] extend region-based captioning to videos. However, these methods still struggle
with capturing intricate details in the referring regions, as shown by the examples in Fig. 5. This is because prior models either extract localized features from global image embeddings or simply encode the referring condition as referring tokens, which leads to insufficient regional details for the LLM, especially for small objects. We address this via focal prompting and a localized vision backbone, balancing local detail with global context.
Another limitation is the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Datasets like RefCOCOs [31, 50] and VG [34] provide only short phrases. Recent approaches [28, 45, 61, 93, 95, 96] use boundingbox-based VLM queries, sometimes augmented with global captions, for synthetic generation, which leads to caveats discussed in App. C.1. We propose an SSL data pipeline that uses human-annotated and unlabeled data for richer regional descriptions.
Benchmarking Localized Captioning. [28, 30, 59, 61, 93, 95, 98, 100, 101] evaluate localized captioning by computing language-based image captioning metrics [2, 5, 43, 56, 79] between predicted captions and reference captions. However, these metrics focus on textual matching and may not correlate well with the factual correctness or quality for detailed descriptions. [95, 96] use Sentence-BERT [63] and text-only LLMs to score the predictions against reference captions. However, reference captions often lack comprehensive details about the region of interest, which penalizes models for correct details not explicitly mentioned in the reference by treating them as hallucinations, as discussed in App. C.2. Our DLC-Bench resolves this issue by eliminating the need for reference captions.

Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
Vision Models with Focus. Prior works enhance attention to salient regions using focal self-attention [90], ToSA [68], ToMe [10], DWViT [65], Quadformer [66], and V* [86]. These methods allocate resources dynamically to salient regions defined by the model. In contrast, our focal prompt explicitly prioritizes user-specified regions, ensuring accurate and detailed captions even for non-salient objects.
3. DAM: Describe Anything Model
Describe Anything Model (DAM) generates detailed localized descriptions of user-specified regions within images and videos. DAM effectively balances local detail and contextual information through our proposed focal prompt and localized vision backbone.
3.1. Task Formulation
The task of detailed localized captioning involves generating comprehensive textual descriptions focused exclusively on specified regions within images or videos. Formally, given N input frames I(i) ∈ RH×W ×3 and corresponding binary masks M (i) ∈ {0, 1}H×W indicating the region of interest in each frame, the objective is to produce a detailed description T of the content within the region through a captioning model:
T = CaptioningModel
(︁
{I(i), M (i)}N
i=1
)︁
(1)
We focus on using binary masks M (i) as the localization input, since other forms of localization (e.g., points, scribbles, boxes, or masks on an image or a subset of frames in a video) can be transformed into masks via segmentation models such as SAM [32] and SAM 2 [62]. For simplicity, we first introduce our method for localized image captioning, omitting the frame index i, and later extend it to videos in Sec. 3.3.
3.2. Model Architecture
As shown in Fig. 3, DAM consists of two key components: the focal prompt and the localized vision backbone.
3.2.1. Focal Prompt
To provide a detailed representation of the region of interest within its context, we introduce the focal prompt, which includes both the full image and a focal

Figure 3: Architecture of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM employs a focal prompt to encode user-specified regions with high token density while preserving context for detailed understanding. Focal cropping is applied to the image and its corresponding mask, retaining surrounding areas for local context. Both the full image and the focal crop are the inputs into the localized vision backbone, where images and binary masks are embedded in a spatially aligned fashion. Global context from the full image is leveraged to help understand the focal crop through gated cross-attention. The resulting visual features and prompt tokens are fed into a large language model to generate detailed, context-aware descriptions. * indicates initialized to output zeros.
crop centered around the specified area, along with their corresponding masks.
We first extract the bounding box B of the mask M and expand it by a factor α in both the horizontal and vertical directions to include additional surrounding context: B′ = ExpandBox(B, α). (2)
For instance, setting α = 3 results in a region that can be up to 9 times as large as the original bounding box, subject to clipping at the image boundaries. If either the height or width of the expanded box is less than 48 pixels, we enforce a minimum size of 48 pixels in that dimension to ensure sufficient context for very

small regions.
The focal crop of the image and mask are then:
I′ = I|B′, M ′ = M |B′, (3)
where |B′ denotes cropping to B′. The focal prompt thus consists of 1) the full image I and its mask M and 2) the focal crop I′ and its mask M ′. By including both the full image and the focal crop, along with their masks, the focal prompt contains both global context and a detailed view of the region of interest.
3.2.2. Localized Vision Backbone
Effectively processing all four components of the focal prompt with a VLM is non-trivial, as naively concatenating the full image and the focal crop leads to a loss in performance (Tab. 8). We propose the localized vision backbone, which 1) achieves localized understanding by encoding the masks in a spatially aligned manner and 2) integrates global context into the region of interest through gated cross-attention.
Handling Localization Inputs. Similar to how an image is encoded by a linear patch embedding layer in vision transformers (ViTs) [24], we integrate the mask M into its corresponding full image I through another patch embedding layer that takes in 2D inputs with one channel.
Specifically, the full image I and its mask M are processed through patch embedding layers, followed by the global vision encoder fG(·) to obtain global visual features z. The focal crop I′ and its mask M ′ undergo a similar process with the regional vision encoder fR(·), except that fR(·) also takes z as a context to obtain the final fused visual features z′. Specifically, we have:
x = EI(I) + EM(M ) + P, z = fG(x), (4)
x′ = EI(I′) + EM(M ′) + P, z′ = fR(x′, z), (5)
where EI(·) and EM(·) are the image and mask patch embedding layer, respectively, x and x′ are global and focal embedded inputs with information for both the image and the mask, and P denotes the positional encoding.
The newly added mask embedding layer EM is initialized to output zeros, ensuring that the VLM’s initial behavior is unaffected prior to fine-tuning.
Regional Feature Encoding with Gated Cross
Attention Adapters. To integrate global context into the focal prompt, we insert gated cross-attention adapters [1, 38] into each transformer block of the regional vision encoder fR. After the self-attention and feed-forward layers, we add a gated cross-attention mechanism that allows local features to attend to global features:
h(l)′ = h(l) + tanh
(︁
γ(l))︁
· CrossAttn

h(l)
Adapter = h(l)′ + tanh
(︁

· FFN
(︁

, (7)
where h(l) is the output of the l-th self-attention block in fR, γ(l) and β(l) are learnable scaling parameters initialized to zero, and CrossAttn denotes cross-attention with queries from h(l) and keys and values from the global features z, similar to how cross-attention is employed in encoder-decoder Transformers [78]. h(l)
Adapter
is used in place of h(l) in the next Transformer block. To reduce the number of parameters, fR shares selfattention block weights with fG.
By initializing γ(l) and β(l) to zero, we ensure that the initial behavior of the model remains identical to the original VLM prior to fine-tuning. During training, the model learns to leverage the global context to enhance local feature representations, facilitating detailed and contextually accurate descriptions.
Generating Detailed Localized Descriptions. The visual features from both the global and regional vision encoders are combined and fed into the large language model to generate detailed, context-aware descriptions T :
T = LLM(t, z′), (8)
where t denotes textual prompt tokens.
Notably, the proposed components do not increase the sequence length of the vision tokens, ensuring that DAM remains efficient. By initializing new modules (mask embedding EM and scaling parameters γ(l) and β(l)) to zeros, we preserve the pre-trained capabilities of the VLM prior to fine-tuning, allowing for smooth adaptation of an off-the-shelf VLM without rerunning pre-training. Thanks to this design, our model requires way less training data (∼ 1.5M samples) than prior works that involve VLM pretraining.

3.3. Extension to Videos
Since images can be considered as videos with a single frame, the model naturally extends to handling videos by processing sequences of frames and their corresponding masks. The visual features from all frames are concatenated in the sequence dimension and fed into the language model to generate detailed localized descriptions across the video frames, compatible with how VLMs are pretrained to handle videos. We leverage SAM 2 [62] to turn sparse localizations into a mask for each frame.
4. DLC-SDP: SSL-based Data Pipeline
The effectiveness of DAM depends critically on the availability of high-quality training data for detailed localized descriptions. To this end, we propose the Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP), a two-stage approach that enables us to build a large and diverse dataset with high-quality localized descriptions.
4.1. Stage 1: Leveraging Existing Annota
tions
The first stage of DLC-SDP reframes the data generation problem into a vision-grounded description expansion task. We observed that although current VLMs often struggle to generate detailed localized descriptions when given a referring mask, they can effectively expand short localized descriptions into detailed ones. Inspired by this observation, we leverage high-quality human-annotated masks and keywords (object class names, part names, entities, etc.) from existing segmentation datasets, reframing the VLM query to expand each regional keyword into a detailed caption given the referring masks.
Importantly, our model is trained to predict these high-quality descriptions without taking the initial keywords as inputs. Since there are no class labels provided at inference time–and existing VLMs perform poorly without them–our approach ensures superior data quality compared to direct VLM prompting for distillation.
4.2. Stage 2: SSL with Unlabeled Data
Since it is not scalable to rely on high-quality manual annotations, the second stage of DLC-SDP employs self-training-based semi-supervised learning
techniques inspired by successful approaches in image classification [7, 8, 69, 89]. Our self-training approach involves four steps:
1. Mask Generation. We use open-vocabulary segmentation models [30, 44] to extract object masks from unlabaled web images.
2. Description Generation. Our DAM, initially trained on the DLC dataset based on annotated segmentation datasets, generates detailed localized descriptions for these regions.
3. Confidence-based Filtering. We apply CLIPbased confidence filtering to keep only highquality samples, following SSL literature. 4. Data Expansion. The newly generated (image, mask, description) triplets are added to our training dataset.
This semi-supervised approach dramatically expands the range of object categories and increases data diversity beyond the initial supervised dataset. Furthermore, to support the capability of DAM for multigranular captioning, we leverage an LLM to summarize the detailed descriptions into shorter forms (e.g., phrases or short sentences), enabling DAM to flexibly generate captions ranging from succinct phrases to multi-sentence narratives.
By systematically curating our training data through this two-stage SSL pipeline, DAM achieves significant performance improvements. Notably, our model trained on data obtained with DLC-SDP outperforms GPT-4o [54] and o1 [55], two strong closed-sourced baselines, showing the effectiveness of DLC-SDP. We present implementation details of DLC-SDP in App. H.
5. DLC-Bench: Benchmark for DLC
We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark designed for DLC to eliminate the need for comprehensive reference captions. The core intuition behind DLC-Bench is that an ideal description should be rich in relevant details while strictly avoiding factual errors or information for irrelevant regions. Therefore, we assess predictions based on a set of predefined positive and negative attributes for each region.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the evaluation process for a model like DAM has two steps:
1. The model is prompted to generate a detailed description for each masked region in the benchmark

dataset. 2. An LLM serves as a judge, assessing the generated description by responding to a set of manually curated positive and negative questions about region details.
DLC-Bench employs two categories of questions for each annotated instance, with example in Fig. A.5:
• Positive questions focus on specific attributes of object parts that should be present in the description. The model earns a point if the description accurately includes the specified detail; omissions receive no points, while factual errors incur a penalty. • Negative questions focus on details that should not be present–either attributes typical of similar objects but absent in the target instance, or descriptions irrelevant to the specified region. A point is awarded if the model correctly omits such details; conversely, including them results in a penalty. To avoid getting high scores for captions that are completely off, point could only be awarded if the caption has the correct recognition of the object.
This approach provides a more flexible and accurate evaluation, encouraging models to generate informative and precise descriptions without constraints from incomplete reference captions.
Our DLC-Bench comprises a total of 892 manually verified questions covering a wide range of attributes and potential cases for hallucinations. Details on the curation process and the scoring mechanism are provided in App. D.

datasets in Tab. 2, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. In the PACO benchmark, a challenging benchmark that includes both full objects and parts in complex scenes and requires the model to decide whether the region is an object or a part, our method achieves 73.2% semantic IoU and 84.2% semantic similarity, outperforming the previous best by 23.2% and 8.5% respectively.
Phrase-level localized captioning task requires the model to output a phrase containing a brief description for each region that includes object identification and attributes typically within a few words. Tested zeroshot on Flickr30k Entities [58], our model achieves strong performance, outperforming the previous best by 12.3% relative improvement on an average of 5 metrics.
Detailed localized captioning task requires the model to output a detailed description for each the region with the length spanning from a long sentence to multiple sentences. An ideal description includes the description of the object in the region, its parts, as well as their attributes and relationships. We benchmark this capability on the challenging Ref-L4 [14] benchmark and our proposed DLC-Bench. On the Ref-L4 benchmark in Tab. 4, our method achieves 33.4% relative improvement on average over the previous best on short language-based captioning metrics [2, 5, 43, 56, 79], and 13.1% relative improvement on the long language-based captioning metrics [13].
We also benchmark various regional captioning models on our proposed DLC-Bench, which does not suffer from the limitations of requiring reference captions in previous benchmarks. As shown in Tab. 5, our Describe Anything Model (DAM) significantly outperforms existing general and region-specific VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art positive and negative accuracy and demonstrating its ability to produce detailed and accurate descriptions. Remarkably, DAM surpasses GPT-4o [54] and o1 [55], two strong API-only baselines. DAM also surpasses models with thinking mode enabled [55, 73, 74].
Detailed localized video captioning requires the model to output a detailed description for each region in a video. We benchmark this capability on the challenging HC-STVG [71] benchmark and the detailed captioning benchmark proposed by VideoRefer [96].

Finally, we analyzed the performance of DAM in HD (hallucination detection) sub-task and found that DAM often predicts correct details not present in the reference caption. This indicates that the lower zero-shot performance on this sub-task is not necessarily due to the hallucination of our model but rather due to the missing details in the reference caption. We illustrate this further in App. C.2.

Using only the full image limits focus on specific regions (48.7%), while local crops improve detail but lose context (60.1%). Simply concatenating both performs poorly (42.4%). Adding cross-attention significantly improves performance (63.2%), and using focal crops further enhances results (65.4%). Our best approach, the focal prompt, integrates focal crops with cross-attention, achieving 67.3% accuracy without increasing sequence length for the LLM.

We developed DLC-SDP, an SSL data pipeline leveraging segmentation datasets and unlabeled web images for high-quality captions. We also proposed DLC-Bench, a benchmark using attribute-based evaluation to overcome limitations of reference-based scoring. DAM achieves SOTA in 7 benchmarks in multi-granular regional captioning.

Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
A. Challenges in Generating Detailed Localized Descriptions with Off-theShelf VLMs
Although cutting-edge Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o [54] and LLaVA [46–48], excel at generating global-level image descriptions, producing detailed localized image captions remains an open problem. Specifically, these VLMs only take in RGB images along with text prompts and do not allow users to accurately specify regions of interest.
While users could employ text to localize the object to be described, this approach is often cumbersome and inefficient, requiring precise referring phrases that may still be difficult for the VLM to interpret. This can lead to mislocalization of the intended object, as illustrated in Fig. A.1(a).
The required effort for both the user and the model can be significantly reduced if the user is allowed to specify the region directly using a representation in 2D coordinates that the model can understand. With this idea in mind, we focus on generating detailed localized descriptions by enabling users to specify a region in an image for the model to describe in detail. Since spatial representations such as points and boxes can be converted into masks using SAM [32] and SAM 2 [62], we concentrate on regions specified by mask inputs.
A first attempt to address this problem with existing VLMs is to reduce the task to global image captioning by presenting only the region to the VLM through masking or cropping, as shown in Fig. A.1(b). While this forces the VLM to focus solely on the specified region, freeing users from the burden of expressing localizations as phrases, the lack of contextual information makes the task much more challenging and often confuses the VLM. This confusion can prevent the model from correctly identifying the object, let alone providing detailed descriptions of its parts. In more extreme cases, the model may even refuse to caption the region due to insufficient information in the cropped or masked image. Therefore, generating detailed localized captions requires more than just the local region.
An alternative approach to prompt existing off-theshelf VLMs for localized descriptions is to overlay markings such as points, scribbles, contours, and alpha
masks on the image [91, 92], as shown in Fig. A.1(c). However, these markings may blend into the object or the background in highly complex scenes, making them unrecognizable to the VLMs. This issue is especially common for small objects that are not the main focus of the scene. Furthermore, the markings may render the image out-of-distribution, confusing the VLMs and disrupting the quality of output that they were originally capable of generating.
The exploration above highlights a conflict between the precision of localization and the availability of context. On one hand, we want the model to accurately focus on a specific region without mentioning other regions, such as other objects or the background. On the other hand, the model needs to leverage contextual information to correctly identify the object in the region of interest. This conflict makes it very difficult for current VLMs to produce high-quality localized descriptions.
Our proposed model overcomes this challenge by taking the localization as a separate input in 2D space. This approach has the advantage of making the localization more explicit for the VLMs to parse while keeping the image within its original distribution, thus preventing the model from being distracted by the markings. This technique leads to accurate localization even in complex scenes, as illustrated in Fig. A.1(d). Note that since Fig. A.1(d) mainly focuses on explaining the design choices of inputting mask inputs to the model, focal prompting is included as a part of the model and is omitted in this figure for simplicity. We refer readers to Fig. 3 for illustrations on focal prompting.
B. Evaluation Benchmarks
Our DAM is designed to perform well at localized image and video captioning across multiple granularities, including keyword, phrase, and detailed captions. Therefore, we evaluate and achieve SOTA in 7 in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks:

We offer an explanation for each setup.
B.1. Keyword-level Localized Captioning
Benchmarks
Open-class keyword-level localized captioning benchmarks, proposed in [95], require the model to output keywords containing the object and part entities to describe the region. In contrast to closed-class keyword-level localized captioning, which constraints the model output to several choices provided, openclass keyword-level localized captioning takes freeform text outputs from the model. The evaluation results are in Tab. 2.
1. For LVIS [29], this involves predicting the class name as a keyword, given the segmentation mask of an object. A typical class name ranges from one word to four words. 2. For PACO [60], this involves predicting the class name of an object in the mask if the mask contains a full object, or the object name and the part name if the mask contains an object part. This is especially challenging because it would require the model to understand nuances between full objects and object parts.
B.2. Phrase-level Localized Captioning
Benchmarks
Phrase-level localized captioning task requires the model to output a phrase containing a brief description for each the region that includes object identification and attributes typically within a few words. The metrics typically used in phrase-level benchmarks are CIDER, METEOR, BLEU, ROUGE_L, and SPICE

1. We perform zero-shot evaluation on detailed captions in the Objects365 [67] split of Ref-L4 [14] since we do not train on Objects365 dataset. We evaluate the prediction quality by computing short captioning metrics and CLAIR [13] score against the reference captions in the dataset. We use CLAIR to evaluate raw detailed outputs, while we summarize both the prediction and ground truth with GPT-4o-mini [54] before evaluation with short captioning metrics. No ground truth or reference captions are provided to GPT4o-mini, with the LLM setting exactly the same for all models for fairness. Results are in Tab. 4. 2. We evaluate our model with DLC-Bench, our proposed benchmark for fine-grained region-based captioning. This evaluation is also zero-shot. We present details about our benchmark in App. D. Results are in Tab. 5.

C. Discussions
C.1. The Caveats of Using Referring Boxes
in Data Pipeline
Caveats exist when boxes are used to refer to regions in the data pipeline. As shown in Fig. A.2, boxes can be ambiguous in terms of what they are referring to, causing uncertainty for the VLM that we use in our data pipeline. In contrast, masks are much more specific in terms of the region that it is referring to. This motivates us to use manually annotated masks in existing segmentation datasets rather than bounding boxes in order to curate high-quality data for DLC with little referring ambiguity. We additionally take

GPT Evaluation on Hallucination Detection (HD) Dimension
Hallucination Detection: 1 Explanation: The predicted answer includes several imaginative elements, such as gestures and expressions, that are not mentioned in the correct answer, indicating hallucinations in the description.
Figure A.3: The pitfall of using reference captions for caption evaluation. Evaluation benchmarks based on reference captions may incorrectly treat correct details in the predicted caption as hallucination. Since the GPT evaluator relies solely on the ground truth caption without viewing the video, it mistakenly flags gestures and expressions as hallucinations, resulting in a low score. However, the evaluation is invalid since the predicted details are correct.
in manually annotated keywords (e.g., class names, part names, entities) in the datasets for regions we are annotating in our data pipeline to further reduce the ambiguity and potential confusion for our VLM in the data pipeline.
C.2. The Pitfall of Using Reference Cap
tions in Benchmarks
As discussed in Sec. 5 and 6.1, caveats exist for using a “ground truth” reference caption for benchmarking localized descriptions. Specifically, since such a reference caption is hardly comprehensive and may not contain all the details about the region of interest, the metrics from the benchmark will treat the correct details in the caption prediction about the region of interest that are not mentioned in the ground truth reference caption as hallucinations. This discourages the model from generating detailed captions.
We analyzed the performance of our method in HD (hallucination detection) sub-task in VideoReferBench [96] and found that our model often predicts correct details that are not present in the reference caption. Specifically, the example in Fig. A.3 shows this phenomenon. While our model’s prediction includes appearance and motion details about the change of the person’s gesture and expression, such details are not mentioned in the reference caption in the dataset. Since the GPT evaluator does not see the video and uses the ground truth caption as the only
source of information, it incorrectly believes that the gestures and expressions are hallucinations and gives our caption a very low score for the hallucination detection dimension. However, the evaluation is not valid, as our model is correct in the descriptions about the gestures and expressions.
This indicates that the lower score on this sub-task is not due to the hallucination of our model, but rather due to the missing details in the reference caption and the fact that our model, evaluated in a zero-shot setting, does not have awareness for what types of details are preferred by or included in the reference caption.
C.3. Failure Cases
We show two failure cases of DAM in Fig. A.4. In Fig. A.4(a), DAM misrecognizes the frog-shaped slipper to be a frog. In Fig. A.4(b), DAM describes the person as pulling the body upward. We expect these errors to be mitigated by broader data coverage.
C.4. Potential Limitations
DAM is only trained for multi-granular localized captioning, especially for detailed localized captioning (DLC) and is not specifically optimized for other general vision-language tasks. However, DAM is designed for in-depth analysis for the task of multi-granular image and video localized descriptions rather than for breadth for general vision-language understanding,

The individual is equipped with a pair of red and white athletic shoes, which provide stability and support during the activity. The person is holding onto a bar or handle with both hands, suggesting a pull-up or similar upper-body exercise. The posture is upright, with the back slightly arched, indicating the exertion of muscles during the movement. The legs are bent at the knees, with feet firmly planted on the ground, providing a stable base. Throughout the sequence, the person maintains a consistent rhythm, pulling the body upward and then lowering it back down in a controlled manner. This repetitive motion showcases the individual's strength and endurance, as they continue the exercise with focus and determination.

which justifies the design choice.
C.5. Computational Efficiency
DAM incorporates our proposed localized vision encoder, which differs from the SigLIP [97] vision encoder used in [44] by adding two key components: patch embedding layers for encoding the mask and cross-attention blocks. Importantly, these components do not alter the dimensions or sequence length of the vision features passed to the large language model, ensuring that the parameter count and computational efficiency of the large language model are unaffected. Since the vision encoder represents only a small fraction of the total parameters and computational operations, the overall increase in FLOPs and parameter count remains marginal, maintaining the model’s efficiency.
To be more specific, unlike prior works that derive regional features from image features for each region,
the regional feature used in our approach comes directly from a global and a focal view of the input image, with cross-attention enhancing the focal representation. This design is justified as the vision encoder is much smaller than the LLM (400M vs. 3B/8B parameters), with minimal latency impact (0.06s compared to 1.49s for 3B LLM as measured in our pipeline). This overhead is outweighed by the benefits of preserving fine details that global image features miss as indicated in Tab. 8), especially for small regions. Finally, DAM 3B outperforms much larger models in challenging (Tab. 5), showing our efficiency.
C.6. Training Data
In addition to the details in data annotation presented in App. H.1, we discuss the training data of our work in this section and present a comparison with recent works. Compared with recent work Ferret [93] which used 1.1M unreleased samples and RegionGPT [28] which used 1.5M unreleased samples,
5


Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
we train our model on a comparable amount of data (1.5M samples). However, we obtain much better performance (Tab. 5), which shows the effectiveness of DAM.
C.7. Performances of Baseline Models on
DLC-Bench
Interestingly, region-specific VLMs often perform on par or worse than generic VLMs. This is likely because many are trained on datasets with short regional captions, leading them to produce brief, phrase-level descriptions. Even when prompted for longer descriptions [28, 100], these models tend to include irrelevant details about the background, speculations, or hallucinations, due to insufficient regional information. Providing crops instead of full images leads to mixed results for different region-specific VLMs since these models are not designed to describe regions in crops.

Image and Instance Selection. We leveraged a subset of the Objects365 v2 [67] validation set, which was manually annotated with segmentation masks in [27], for image and instance selection. We collected a set of 892 challenging questions from this subset, each containing one object of interest. Each question is manually inspected, and questions with ambiguous or unclear answers are filtered out. To maintain the integrity of our benchmark, we conducted de-duplication to ensure that no images used in the benchmark were present in our training dataset for detailed localized captioning.
Positive Question Generation. For each masked region, we prompted an off-the-shelf Visual Language Model (VLM) to generate a list of parts. Subsequently, for the whole object and each part, we asked the VLM to generate a list of properties covering aspects such as color, shape, texture, materials, and size. Each property is stored in the form ([object name], [part
name], [property name], [property value]).
For example, if the masked region is a corgi, the VLM could describe the brown fur of the corgi as (corgi,
fur, color, brown).
We used this list of properties as a starting point for manual curation. We then manually added significant properties that the VLM missed, revised inaccurate
properties, and removed hallucinated or ambiguous properties from the VLM outputs. Finally, we turned these properties into questions that test whether a description accurately covers the property.
Negative Question Generation. We targeted mislocalization and hallucination, which are two types of negatives (i.e., cases in which a property or an object should not be included in the descriptions). Specifically, for mislocalization errors, we prompted the VLMs to generate a list of objects in the image that are not in the masked region. We also prompted the VLMs to generate a list of parts that are commonly associated with the object type of the masked region but are not present or visible in the masked object in the image (e.g., the head of a corgi if it is occluded and thus not included in the masked region).
To avoid biasing towards one specific off-the-shelf VLM, we leveraged multiple VLMs for different instances to generate initial positives and negatives. Specifically, we annotated 34 regions using GPT4o [54], 35 using Gemini 1.5 Pro [75, 76], and 31 using Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet [72] for the initial property generation. We used the same image prompting method for all VLMs as we did when prompting the VLMs in the first stage of our data pipeline.
Note that the choices for each question are mutually exclusive, which ensures one option is always valid and leaves no room for two options to be true at the same time.
Scoring Mechanism. Our evaluation methodology involves scoring the models based on their ability to include correct details and exclude incorrect or irrelevant information.
To evaluate a model like DAM for its ability to output detailed localized captions, we first prompt the model to generate descriptions for each of the masked instances. Then, instead of directly asking our model to provide answers to these questions, we prompt a text-only LLM, Llama 3.1 8B [25], to serve as a judge to rate the localized descriptions according to the positive and negative questions.
For each model-generated description, we apply the following scoring rules:
• Positive Scoring: For each positive question, if

Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
Q: Which of the following is applicable to the description? Choices:
A. The control panel or the stove is not mentioned. (score: 0) B. The location of the control panel is mentioned in the description but is not back. (score: -1) C. The location of the control panel is mentioned in the description and is back. (score: 1) D. The location of the control panel is not mentioned, but the control panel of the stove is mentioned. (score: 0.5)
(c) An example positive question in DLC-Bench
(a) An example region in the
benchmark for the model to describe Q: Which of the following is applicable to the description? Choices:
A. The induction cooktop surface of the stove is mentioned in the description. (score: -1)
B. The induction cooktop surface of the stove is not mentioned in the description. (score: 1) C. The stove is not mentioned in the description. (score: 0)
(d) An example negative question in DLC-Bench
Task: describe this region
(b) An example description to be evaluated

Figure A.5: An example from DLC-Bench for detailed localized captioning. (a) The process begins by prompting a model to describe a specified region within the image. The resulting description is then evaluated using a text-only LLM as a judge that rates each response by answering positive and negative questions. (b) shows an example description to be evaluated. (c) Positive questions are designed to test whether the model correctly identifies specific details within the described region. The model receives points for accurate details and is penalized for factual errors. The bold option (option C) indicates that the LLM judge believes that option C is applicable, allowing the model to get a point for this example positive question. (d) Negative questions ensure the model refrains from mentioning irrelevant or nonexistent details. Mislocalization or hallucination results in penalties to prevent false positives. The bold option (option B) indicates that the LLM judge believes that option B is applicable, allowing the model to get a point for this negative question.
the description correctly includes the specified detail, the model receives a point. To prevent models from artificially inflating their scores by generating excessively long descriptions and guessing details, we penalize incorrect details and discourage models from including uncertain or erroneous content. If the detail is mentioned but incorrectly (e.g., wrong color), a penalty of one point is applied. No point is awarded if the description does not mention the detail. Partial points (0.5 points) are awarded for answers that are partially correct but insufficiently detailed. Note that the model gets positive points only when the object recognition is correct, as the correctness of the details depends on the correctness of the overall region recognition. We present a positive example in Fig. A.5(c). • Negative Scoring: For each negative question, if the description appropriately excludes the incorrect or irrelevant detail, the model gets a point. If the description includes the detail, indicating mislocalization or hallucination, a penalty is applied. The model gets zero or negative points
when the object recognition is incorrect, since otherwise a caption that is random and completely off could get high scores on the negative questions. We present a negative example in Fig. A.5(d).
The positive (negative) score for a model is the sum of points for positive (negative) questions, normalized by the maximum possible score to yield a percentage for comparison. We also average the positive and negative scores to obtain an overall score, which represents the model’s overall capability in detailed localized captioning.
We present an example from DLC-Bench in Fig. A.5. The example region in Fig. A.5(a) features a stove with coil burners. An example description of the region is presented in Fig. A.5(b). For the example positive question in Fig. A.5(c), the LLM judge selects option C, as the caption correctly mentions that the control panel is at the back, allowing the model to get a point for this positive question. For the negative question in Fig. A.5(d), the LLM judge selects option B, as the caption correctly indicates that it is not an induction

Evaluation Setting. For our models, we follow our inference setting described in App. H.
E. Additional Ablation Studies
Model Architecture with the Same Training Data. A model’s performance is largely due to two factors: model architecture design and training data. Since both factors differ for different models, it is hard to compare the effectiveness of different model architectures head-to-head.
To this end, we compare our model architecture against VP-SPHINX [45], the strongest prior baseline in most benchmarks that we tested on. By continuously training a VP-SPHINX model [45] on our data after pre-training on the originally proposed datasets. This is a fair comparison since our method is also fine-tuned from a pretrained VLM, VILA-1.5 [44], with two stages of training prior to training on our region-specific dataset.
As shown in Tab. A.1, our model architecture achieves much better performance on detailed localized captioning benchmark DLC-Bench with trained on the same dataset from our proposed data pipeline. This justifies that our proposed focal prompt and localized visual backbone are able to provide more detailed features compared to just the global image features extracted by a vision encoder on the full image with a regional referring feature, as employed in [45].
Prompt Augmentation. We compared variants of our model with and without prompt augmentation. As shown in Tab. A.2, incorporating prompt augmentation slightly degrades our model’s performance on the positive questions in our benchmark. We hypothesize that despite introducing variations in the prompts and enhancing the model’s instruction-following capabilities, prompt augmentation creates a mismatch between the prompts used during training and those used during evaluation (as we always use the same prompt for evaluation, which is detailed in App. H.3). Since the prompt used during evaluation might not be the same as the prompt used in training, the model may also occasionally reference other tasks from our mixing dataset ShareGPT-4V for the length of outputs. This may cause the model to produce outputs that are
not as detailed as when it is trained exclusively with the original prompt. Importantly, the model’s performance on the negative questions remains unchanged, indicating that prompt augmentation does not lead to hallucinations or mislocalization.
Despite the slight degradation of the performance in the benchmark (0.6% in the overall accuracy), we observed that prompt augmentation improves instruction-following capabilities when prompts include additional instructions, particularly those specifying requirements on the length of the outputs. Therefore, we default to using the model without prompt augmentation in our benchmark evaluations, including ablations. In contrast, we employ the model with prompt augmentation in the qualitative evaluations.
Image-only Training vs Image+Video Joint Training. We also compared our image-only DAM with DAM with image + video joint training in Tab. A.3. We show that our model with image-video joint training slightly outperforms our model with image-only training on detailed localized image captioning. Note that for this ablation study, we keep the model size the same and use the 3B model for both image-only training and image-video joint training. We use imageonly training as the default option for results in our benchmark for simplicity.
F. Additional Quantitative Results
Set-of-Marks Prompting. We present a comparison with baseline VLMs that use Set-of-Marks (SoM) prompting [91] in Tab. A.4. SoM leads to degraded results compared to the prompt engineering method used in stage one of our data annotation pipeline. This is mostly because the marks proposed by SoM blend in with the object or the background in complex scenes. They might also mask out some part of the object, which interferes with the model’s understanding capabilities. Therefore, for fair comparisons, we use the same prompt engineering method as we use in stage one of our data annotation pipeline in our main result in Tab. 5. Importantly, region-specific VLMs, including DAM, have predefined ways of encoding regional inputs, making SoM inapplicable to these models.

We use the model without prompt augmentation with our benchmark, including ablations, by default.

G. Additional Qualitative Results
G.1. Detailed Localized Image Captioning
In Fig. A.7, we present additional examples from LVIS [29] to show our model’s strong performance on detailed localized image captioning.
Our model demonstrates robust localization and region understanding capabilities. In the first example, it accurately describes the sofa cushion without mentioning the dog that is outside the masked region. In the second example, it correctly identifies the roller blind, which would be challenging to recognize based solely on a local crop without context. In the third example, the model provides a detailed description of the giraffe without referencing the birds perched on it, as they fall outside the masked region. These examples highlight our model’s precise localization abilities and its effectiveness in perceiving regional details with contextual understanding.
G.2. Zero-shot QA Capabilities
Although not trained on any regional QA datasets, DAM surprisingly exhibits emerging zero-shot capabilities on regional QA.
In Fig. A.6, we show examples of our model performing zero-shot QA. DAM is able to identify properties of objects in the masked regions. For example, it is able to identify the color of the clothing, the material of the stick, and the textural pattern of the fish in the first three examples. DAM is also capable of performing object recognition for a region in the image, identifying the strawberry in the last image.
G.3. Detailed Localized Video Captioning
We present more examples for detailed localized video captioning in Fig. A.8 and Fig. A.9. Our model can describe objects in videos with large object motion and camera motion. DAM can also identify stationary objects by indicating that they are stationary in the description.

G.4. Qualitative Comparisons with Strong
Baselines
Detailed Localized Image Captioning. We also present qualitative comparisons with GPT-4o [54] and our strongest open-weight baseline VP-SPHINX [45] in detailed localized image captioning in Fig. A.10.
In both examples, GPT-4o could not correctly recognize the objects in the masked regions, providing only vague descriptions. VP-SPHINX, while better than GPT4o, still struggles with accurate object recognition and detailed descriptions. In the left image, VP-SPHINX incorrectly describes a group of seals when the masked region contains only one seal. In the right image, VP-SPHINX identifies the towel but provides minimal detail, missing key attributes like its color and texture.
Our model outputs detailed and high-quality descriptions of the seal and the towel. This improvement stems from our model’s design which enables the fusion of object-specific information with broader contextual understanding.

To ensure data quality, we apply extensive filtering (i.e., rejection sampling) based on confidence scores from OWL-ViT v2, SAM, and SigLIP image-text similarity. We also ensure we have at most two instances per image, and for images with two instances, these two instances have to be from different classes. The object category names produced by OWL-ViT v2 are then put into a variant of our Describe Anything model, which is trained on data from stage 1 and optimized for selflabeling. This variant generates descriptions with a 50% probability of incorporating class names during training, as during self-labeling we have a class name as a part of each input. The object category proposals used by OWL-ViT v2 are generated by VILA 1.5 [44].
Detailed localized video captioning. We annotated 94k regions across 37k videos from SA-V dataset [62] for detailed localized video captioning, as detailed in Tab. A.6. Note that each region, also called masklet, indicates an instance across multiple frames in the video. In contrast to the use of SA-1B, where we did not use the masks that come with the dataset,
we use the high-quality masklets that come with the videos. We found that many masklets cover parts of an instance, which is not necessarily helpful in describing the whole object as a common use case of our model. Therefore, we performed instance segmentation on the videos with ViTDet [41] + Cascade Mask R-CNN [12] trained by EVA-02 [26] and used voting to match the segmentation masks with the masklets. In this way, we filter out most of the masklets that are parts, since they likely do not correspond to instance masks. The matched masklets carry the class name from the matched instance segmentation mask, which is used in the annotation process to obtain a detailed localized caption for each masklet.
H.2. Model Training
We start from off-the-shelf VILA 1.5 [44] models that are publicly available on HuggingFace. For image-only training, we fine-tune VILA 1.5 3B model. For joint image-video training, we use VILA 1.5 8B model. We use SigLIP [97] vision encoder, following VILA 1.5. To prevent catastrophic forgetting and to maintain instruction following capabilities, we mix in ShareGPT

Input Video
Input Video
An animal is present in the region, initially appearing as a sheep with a woolly coat. It stands on a patch of ground with sparse vegetation. As the sequence progresses, the animal undergoes a series of transformations. Its appearance shifts from a sheep to a creature resembling a wolf, with a sleeker, more streamlined body and a different texture. The transformation continues as the animal takes on the form of a pig, with a rounded body and a pinkish hue. This change is gradual, with the animal's features morphing smoothly from one form to another. Throughout these transformations, the animal remains in a similar position, occasionally adjusting its stance slightly. The sequence concludes with the animal returning to a sheep-like form, completing the cycle of transformations.
A sheep with a thick, woolly coat of light beige and white fur is seen moving gracefully. Its body is robust and rounded, with a slightly curved back. The sheep's head is small in proportion to its body, with a pair of alert, medium-sized ears that stand upright. As it moves, the sheep's legs are sturdy and well-positioned, supporting its weight as it walks with a steady, deliberate pace. The tail is short and slightly curved, adding to its balanced silhouette. Throughout the sequence, the sheep maintains a consistent gait, suggesting a calm and purposeful demeanor. Its movements are smooth and "luid, indicating a sense of ease and familiarity with its surroundings.
A cow is standing in an outdoor area, tethered with a rope. Its body is mostly stationary, with slight movements as it shifts its weight from one leg to another. The cow occasionally "licks its tail, indicating a relaxed state. Its head is lowered, possibly grazing or sni#ing the ground. The cow's coat is smooth, with a consistent color pattern. As the sequence progresses, the cow takes small steps forward, adjusting its position slightly. The motion is gradual, with the cow maintaining a calm demeanor throughout.
GPT-4o
A cow with a rich brown coat and a lighter patch on its rump is depicted in a sequence of movements. Initially, the cow is seen with its head slightly lowered, suggesting a calm demeanor. As the sequence progresses, the cow begins to move forward, its legs extending in a steady, rhythmic gait. The tail, with its tufted end, sways gently with each step, adding a sense of "luidity to its motion. The cow's body remains mostly upright, with its back slightly arched, indicating a relaxed posture. The legs, sturdy and well-de"ined, carry the cow forward with a sense of purpose. Throughout the sequence, the cow maintains a consistent pace, its movements smooth and unhurried, embodying a serene and composed presence.
DAM (Ours)
A cow, tethered by a rope, stands in a courtyard surrounded by other cows and a blue vehicle. The cow's body is predominantly light brown with darker patches, and it has a white patch on its face. Its tail is slightly raised, and it appears to be looking around, possibly observing its surroundings or reacting to sounds. The cow remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a calm demeanor. The background includes a concrete "loor scattered with some debris, a wall with a window, and a blue vehicle parked nearby. The overall scene suggests a rural setting where the cows are likely being kept for grazing or other agricultural purposes.
A sheep stands in a "ield, initially facing forward. It then turns its head to the left, looking over its shoulder. The sheep's body remains mostly stationary, but its head movement suggests it might be reacting to something off-camera. The background consists of dry grass and scattered twigs, indicating an outdoor rural setting.

Figure A.11: Our proposed DAM demonstrates superior localized video understanding compared to GPT-4o [54], QwenVL-2.5 [77], and VideoRefer [96]. Top figure: DAM accurately captures the cow’s forward movement with comprehensive details, whereas GPT-4o and QwenVL-2.5 mistakenly perceive the cow as stationary. Compared to VideoRefer, DAM provides richer descriptions of both motion and appearance. Bottom figure: DAM correctly recognizes the animal as a sheep and accurately describes its graceful movement, while GPT-4o erroneously identifies it as transforming into other animals, and QwenVL-2.5 incorrectly perceives that only the sheep’s head is moving. VideoRefer provides limited appearance details, while DAM offers extensive, accurate descriptions. These cases highlight DAM’s precise understanding of motion and appearance throughout video sequences.

Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
1 You are responsible to write a very descriptive caption to describe the {{category}} in the provided SEGMENTED image. You may leverage the surrounding context of the SEGMENTED image provided in the CROPPED image. 2 You must not mention any background in the caption and only describe the {{category}} in the SEGMENTED image! The caption must ONLY contain sufficient details to reconstruct the same {{category}} in the SEGMENTED image but nothing else! 3 Here are some additional rules you need to follow when describing the {{category}} in the SEGMENTED image: 4 1. If there are multiple {{category}} in the CROPPED image , focus on the {{category}} in the SEGMENTED image. 5 2. If the {{category}} in the SEGMENTED image is occluded by other objects , only describe the visible part. DO NOT mention anything that is not directly related to the visible part of {{ category}}, such as "A segment of", which part is invisible , etc. For objects with text written on it , describe the object instead of just outputting the text written on it. 6 Here is the SEGMENTED image that needs caption:
Table A.7: Our prompt for data annotation in stage 1.
4V [16] with our localized image/video captioning dataset collected with our proposed data pipeline. Following the VILA 1.5 training and inference recipe, we treat videos as 8 images concatenated in the sequence.
We closely follow VILA 1.5’s recipe of the supervised fine-tuning stage and train all modules, including the vision backbone, the projector, and the LLM. We finetune the model for 1 epoch. For the 3B model, we use a batch size of 2048 with a learning rate of 1e-4 on 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. For the 8B model, we use a batch size of 2048 with a learning rate of 1e-5 on 32 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Both models take less than a day to train. We use a cosine scheduler with a warmup ratio of 0.03. No weight decay is used. For training our model that takes in a class name for self-labeling, we randomly put the class name in the prompt with 50% probability. For models without prompt augmentation, which is detailed below, we simply use the prompt “Describe
the masked region in detail.” Following VILA, we always put image tokens in front of the textual tokens. As for the setting for the focal crop, we extend the crop by 1× the width towards left and right, and 1× the height towards top and bottom, unless we hit the boundaries of the image, in which case we take the boundaries, i.e. α = 3 and the total area of the crop is enlarged up to 9×. If either the height or width is less than 48 pixels, we take 48 pixels for that direction to encode more context for very small regions, since the small regions themselves do not have much useful information.
Prompt Augmentation. We trained a variant of our model with prompt augmentation to enhance generalization capabilities beyond detailed localized caption
ing, as analyzed in App. G. For these models, during training, we randomly select one of 15 prompts from a predefined set. These prompts may or may not include a {prompt_suffix}. The default prompt suffix is in detail. However, we introduce variability by conditioning the prompt on the number of words or sentences in the target caption.
Specifically, with a 20% probability, we condition the prompt on the number of sentences, using suffixes like in one sentence or in [number of sentences] sentences (e.g., in 2 sentences). If the caption contains only one sentence, we use phrases like in a sentence or in one sentence.
With another 20% probability, we condition the prompt on the number of words in the target caption. For captions with a small word count, we use exact numbers (e.g., in 3 words). For longer captions (up to 200 words), we may round the word count to the nearest ten and use phrases like in about 50 words or in around 50 words. If the caption exceeds 200 words, we use the suffix in more than 200 words.
The list of prompts that include a {prompt_suffix} is as follows:
1. Describe the masked region {prompt_suffix}. 2. Describe the masked area {prompt_suffix}. 3. What can you describe about the masked region
{prompt_suffix}?
4. Can you describe the masked region
{prompt_suffix}?
5. Provide an explanation of the masked region
{prompt_suffix}.
6. Depict the masked area {prompt_suffix}.
16


Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning
7. Portray the masked area {prompt_suffix}. 8. Describe what the masked region looks like
{prompt_suffix}.
9. Illustrate the masked region {prompt_suffix}. 10. How would you explain the masked area
{prompt_suffix}?
11. What details can you provide about the masked
region {prompt_suffix}?
12. What does the masked region entail
{prompt_suffix}?
13. How would you illustrate the masked region
{prompt_suffix}?
14. How would you depict the masked area
{prompt_suffix}?
15. How would you portray the masked area
{prompt_suffix}?
Additionally, we have prompts that inherently request detailed descriptions without requiring a suffix:
1. Give a detailed description of the masked region. 2. Provide a thorough description of the masked region. 3. Can you explain the details of the masked area? 4. Give a detailed account of the masked region. 5. Describe the masked area comprehensively. 6. Provide an in-depth description of the masked region. 7. Explain the specifics of the masked area. 8. Can you provide a thorough explanation of the masked region? 9. What are the details of the masked area? 10. Provide a comprehensive description of the masked area. 11. What specific details can you provide about the masked region? 12. Can you give an in-depth account of the masked section? 13. What are the main characteristics of the masked region? 14. Give a thorough description of the masked area’s details. 15. Provide detailed information about the masked area.
For prompts without a suffix, we do not condition the generation on the number of words or sentences.
During training, we select prompts based on the
prompt_suffix:
• If the prompt_suffix is in detail (the default option), we may choose from either set of prompts. • If the prompt_suffix specifies word or sentence counts, we select only from prompts that include
{prompt_suffix}.
This approach introduces variability in the prompts, encouraging the model to generate responses with controls from the prompts in mind, thereby enhancing its generalization and instruction-following capabilities.
H.3. Inference Setting
Unless otherwise mentioned, our prompt for obtaining detailed localized image descriptions at inference time is the following:
Describe the masked region in detail.
Our prompt for obtaining detailed localized video descriptions at inference time is the following:
Given the video in the form of a sequence
of frames above, describe the object in
the masked region in the video in detail.
Focus on appearance, motion, and actions.
If the motion involves multiple stages or
steps, break down each stage and describe
the movements or changes sequentially.
Ensure each phase of motion is described
clearly, highlighting transitions between
actions.
For Co3Dv2 [64] sequences that we treat as videos, we use the following prompt:
Describe the masked region in the video
in detail. The video consists of multiple
views of a stationary object. Focus on the
appearance of the object without mentioning
any motion or actions.
